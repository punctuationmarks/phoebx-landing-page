          If you had luck over 5%, you might have seen some "glitches" on my
          site and turned off JS. So why browse the web without JavaScript?
          Well, this entire site is running code on your machine. Do you know
          what all of that code is or does? Well, you can see for yourself on
          <a
            href="https://github.com/punctuationmarks/phoebx-landing-page"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
          >
            github
          </a>
          if you so choose. If not, you'll just have to trust me that I have the
          best intentions and best execution of running code that won't be
          malicious or accidentally harmful on your computer. Honestly this site
          should be benign at worst (unless Facebook injects a hidden trackers
          inside React's source code, which at this point in my career I
          honestly wouldn't be surpised by at all), but I understand not wanting
          to run unauditable code on your own machines. I honestly try to avoid
          proprietary JS in my personal life as much as possible since privacy
          and security are important to me as well.

        <h3>Then why is this site written in JavaScript??</h3>
        <p>
          Well, one's journey is not a straight line and honestly I chose a tech
          stack that I think is inherently insecure when I originlly built this
          website. Since then I've learned a lot and am, ideally, a bit wiser.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm aiming to make up for that, with future projects and where I spend
          my time and money, and although this site will probably
          always be written in JS, just since it's already open code and I have
          other more important projects to work on, I do hope you don't mind
          running this code on your browser It has some educational material and
          info about my small business. But I get it, and I wish you luck in
          your journey. Thanks reading and I do hope you're well.
