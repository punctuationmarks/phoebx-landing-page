        So why browse the web without JavaScript? Well, this entire site is
        running code on your machine. Do you know what all of that code is or
        does? Well, you can see for yourself at
        <span> https://github.com/punctuationmarks/phoebx-landing-page </span>
        if you so choose. If not, you'd have to trust me that I have the best
        intentions and best execution of running code that won't be malicious on
        your computer.

        <h3>Why is this site written in JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>
          Well, one's journey is not a straight line and I chose a poor
          technology stack when I originlly built this website.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm aiming to make up for that and am in progress to build a new site
          soon. With some educational material and guides I've been working on.
          Thanks for your patience and I do hope you're well.
