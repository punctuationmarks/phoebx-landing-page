# Hardware

Add the country of origin and maybe do some research on how to track down a product’s entire pipeline. Make comments on the design as well as the quality of craftmanship and materials. 



### Keyboards and mice
- Redragon Karura2 K502RGB Keyboard
	- Stiff like it was covered in molassas and then licked clean. It honestly wasn’t cheap, but doesn’t hit any midrange at all. It’s clunky as a daily keyboard, slows one down and makes navigating a keyboard for any period of time a slow, tediously painful experience. Like walking INSERT_AN_ACTUAL_DISTANCE_YOU_WALKED in the same pair of unwashed socks and boots.
- Dell Wireless Keyboard and Mouse combo ($75 in 2020)
	- Sleek, easy to type on. Nice to have a Bluetooth usb-a remote as well, since not every computer has Bluetooth (and honestly, I don't see why many do)

### USB drives
- Mosdart 3.0 USB drives
	- They were cheap and feels cheap too, but none have crashed yet.
- SP Silicon Power 3.0 64GB D33B29
	- Crap, feels like it should be nice, but isn’t. Have failed multiple times
- SanDisk USB 3.0 & USB-C swiveled combo 128GB BP21958017W
	- Crap, feels like it should be nice (fully metal body). Quick writes and reads, but overheats very quickly. It feels like it’ll damage the computer’s USB port if left in for more than 15 minutes.
- Librem Drive 32GB USB 3.0 & USB-C swiveled combo
	- The only downside to this portable drive is how small the memory is. It feels strong and durable, looks like a sleek cyberpunk tool and keeps up with daily use between machines. It is a multi-tool for the worker who thinks of themselves as blue color 


### Security keys
- Yubikey
	A Yubikey is a TOPT [[what does the exact acronym stand for?]] that is made by the company Yubikey. It uses [[the protocol it uses, physical hardware key but what’s the underlining technology?]] to ensure you are who you say you are in addition to your username and password. This technology protocol allows the users to have things like a 
	
Why doesn’t everyone of my fiat accepting banks have this feature built in? Why doesn’t even one bank in the USA do it?


- Librem key
	There’s a lot going on in this little system, so even though it feels dinky, I think it’s worth while. 

### Computers
- Dell G5 Laptop
	Maybe it’s just because I’ve broken more than a few fingers, but this laptop’s keyboard and trackpad hurts to navigate. Which is such a disappointment since the keys feel responsive. I think it’s due to where the shift key is located on top of the most poorly positioned track pad. Do they think the entire world is only right handed and only wants to use their right hand all of the time? 

I should probably talk shit about the battery. It is terrible, always has been and only gotten worse with age. It has become a defacto desktop with a screen. But it is a decent desktop, if you’re running some variation of Linux/BSD. The few times I’ve run Windows 10, it’s been like running a [[ insert a fast muscle car here, that you have some experience ]] in second gear wondering why the engine is overheating when you do, eventually, hit the speed limit.

I was surprised to see how many microphones were located in this laptop. And how small they are, it’s like they took microphones from mobile phones and placed the around the laptop because Dell and Windows are just dying to hear your opinion of them. 

But since it’s been a semi-daily driver for the last  years, going through a dozen operating systems, machine learning training, data wrangling and analysis, web development and even some gaming and graphic manipulation. It’s a beast, and I’m never surprised that it just continues on chugging along. It is that vehicle that only you can start, but once it’s going you have full control over your machine, buuut just as long as you can get it to start.  


- Dell G5 Gaming Desktop
- Librem Purism Laptop 
	Okay, I’m surprised to say that this laptop might not only be the most secure I’ve used, but also the easiest to type on and navigate. I’m not sure how much the Intel ME has been disabled [hello alphabet boys :)], but it is nice to have some hardware switches for wifi and the mic and laptop camera [[insert link to Librem’s Intel ME article]]. I honestly don’t trust much anything eletronic these days, so obvious the mics and speakers needed to be removed, and the wifi can stay on this device for the time being. [[talk about how easy/difficult removing all the speakers/mics was]]. The price point is a bit high, but I think this runs faster and smoother than my standard issued Apple M1 and also I honestly like the idea that I’m supporting someone in the technology space that is supporting projects like PureOS and FOSS in general ontop of more secure hardware, since even if a persistent threat actor can get into my device, I’m glad I’m no longer a low hanging fruit for other, less skilled actors.
