# Hardware

### Keyboards and mice
- Dell wired keyboard and mouse, the ones they just give to you
	
	Simple, classic and durable. It isn't a fast keyboard, but it will remind you of the nicest keyboard ever produced in the 90s. 

- Dell Wireless Keyboard and Mouse combo
	
	Sleek, easy to type on. Nice to have a Bluetooth usb-a remote as well, since not every computer has Bluetooth (and honestly, I don't see why many do)

- Redragon Karura2 K502RGB Keyboard

	Stiff like it was covered in molassas and then licked clean. It honestly wasn’t cheap, but doesn’t hit any midrange standards at all. It’s clunky as a daily keyboard, slows one down and makes navigating a keyboard for any period of time a slow, tediously painful experience. Like walking 1500km in the same pair of unwashed socks and boots.

### USB drives

- Mosdart 3.0 USB drives

	They were cheap and feels cheap too, but none have crashed after much use.

- SP Silicon Power 3.0 64GB D33B29

	Feels like it should be nice, but isn’t. Have failed multiple times.

- SanDisk USB 3.0 & USB-C swiveled combo 128GB BP21958017W

	Feels and looks like it should be nice with a full metal body. Quick writes and reads, but overheats very quickly. It feels like it’ll damage the computer’s USB port if left in for more than 15 minutes.

- Librem Drive 32GB USB 3.0 & USB-C swiveled combo

	The only downside to this portable drive is how small the memory is. It feels strong and durable, looks like a sleek cyberpunk tool and keeps up with daily use between machines. It is a multi-tool for the worker who thinks of themselves as blue collar. 


### Security keys

- Yubikey

	A Yubikey is a TOPT that is made by the company of the same name. It uses [[the protocol it uses, physical hardware key but what’s the underlining technology?]] to ensure you are who you say you are in addition to your username and password. This technology protocol allows the users to have things like sensitive material connected to the internet and not feel like a good hash-cracking GPU and some luck is the only thing standing between it and the attacker. Why doesn’t everyone of my fiat accepting banks have this feature built in? Why doesn’t even one bank in the USA do it?

- Librem key

	In case you didn't know, a LibremKey is a USB device that generates a private and public key combination is used to ensure that the holder is either the only one who can access a computer or like an intrusion detection device to let you know "hey, someone else was here". There’s a lot going on in this little system, so even though it feels a bit dinky, I think the concept is worth while. I don't like that it's not water proof, but it feels _kinda_ durable. 

### Computers
 
- Apple MacBook Pro Intel

	It's kinda sleek, at first glance. They removed the function keys (partially) and replaced it with _another_ screen? Wait, no the function keys do show up, but only at predetermined times. I can hear [[insert author's name]] in "My Life in Code" complaining that her computer took away her autonomy. (Her system crashed, corrupted her files, the OS just informed her with a big button that said "OK". No option, but to press it.) When it runs, it's nice, but that's mainly due to all of the developers who built their lives around it. Ported nearly every app for Apple products.  

	How many times do I need to send this in for repairs? No, they won't let me take it apart and fix it myself. It's only 3 years old? Trash.

- Apple MacBook Pro M1

	Great, now we all know about PacMAN and every time I touch this computer I have to ensure every piece of software is up to date and patched and those patches have no bugs or security vulnerabilities... and Apple isn't doing a full recall? So every nation state with a cyber division and every kid with too much spare time can hack into any M1 machine, as long as they find any way in? Fun.

	Very secure, Apple, very private, very on brand.

	But hey! At least it doesn't crash once a week like the Intel model. But all the devs haven't ported everything over just yet, so it'll be a mix and match of programs and applications until they get off their lazy asses and can. No hidden bugs anywhere that could lead to security vulnerabilites in that mess, no sir.   

- Dell G5 Laptop

	Maybe it’s just because I’ve broken more than a few fingers, but this laptop’s keyboard and trackpad hurts to navigate, which is such a disappointment since the keys feel responsive. I think it’s due to the shift key being located ontop of the most poorly positioned track pad. Do they think the entire world is only right handed and only wants to use their right hand all of the time? I should probably talk shit about the battery. It is terrible, always has been and only gotten worse with age. It has become a defacto desktop with a screen. 
	But overall it is a decent desktop, if you’re running some variation of Linux/BSD. The few times I’ve run Windows 10, it’s been like running a Mazarati in second gear wondering why the engine is overheating when you do, eventually, hit the speed limit.
	I was surprised to see how many microphones were located in this laptop. And how small they are, it’s like they took microphones from mobile phones and placed the around the laptop, probably because Dell and Windows are just dying to hear your opinion of them. I do like how easy it is to customize it, within limits. 
	But it’s durable enough to be a daily driver for years, go through a dozen operating systems, machine learning training, data wrangling and analysis, web development and even some gaming and graphic manipulation. It’s a beast and I’m never surprised that it just continues on chugging along. It is that vehicle that only you can start, but once it’s going you have full control over your machine, buuut just as long as you can get it to start.

- Librem Purism Laptop 

	Okay, I’m surprised to say that this laptop might not only be the most secure I’ve used, but also the easiest to type on and navigate. I’m not sure how much the Intel ME has been disabled [hello alphabet boys :)], but it is nice to have some hardware switches for wifi and the mic and laptop camera [[insert link to Librem’s Intel ME article]]. I honestly don’t trust much anything eletronic these days, so obvious the mics and speakers needed to be removed, and the wifi can stay on this device for the time being. [[talk about how easy/difficult removing all the speakers/mics was]]. The price point is a bit high, but I think this runs faster and smoother than my standard issued Apple M1 and also I honestly like the idea that I’m supporting someone in the technology space that is supporting projects like PureOS and FOSS in general ontop of more secure hardware, since even if a persistent threat actor can get into my device, I’m glad I’m no longer a low hanging fruit for other, less skilled actors.

- Raspberry Pi

	These little suckers can be useful, but pretty much if you need a fully operating system or just don't mind the bloat. You could always run it headless, but I'd suggest sticking to an Arduino and using a lower level language if your main goal is automation. With my 2$ out of the way, they are a briliant technological feat. A full computer that can fit in my hand, with full I/O pins and a thiving community around it. It's a thing of beauty. If you just need a small system to browse the internet and watch videos, it's perfect. If you need a system to run a small webserver with just solarpower, the RPi is there for you.
