# Software

Just an opinion: If it's proprietary software, then it’s most likely spyware that analyze your key strokes, stores them for longer than the life of the company, and uses machine learning to sell you more cheap plastic that you don’t need. It also puts the user under the observer effect, which makes them behave differently once knowing they are being watched in some manner.

### DESKTOP APPS

#### Text Processing
- MicroSoft Word

	It is a piece of software than has had X iterations over X years. It has had some of the best software engineers on the planet work on it, like X, X, and X. But it is clunky and puts one in a mindset of partially-visible boxes. The tool bar overwhelms one, even if the eye is initially drawn to the beautiful, crisp, 0.7%-shadow-to-make-it-feel-like-it’s-floating, blank page.  Why is the default have its canvas at a precise 2/5ths of the page width? 


- LibreOffice Writer

	This should have it’s own review, not just saying it’s a copy of MS Word. Give it something good. A human took their time to make it and to give it away for free. This is a functionally complex piece of software that probably started with Microsoft’s Word as its muse and give users something that is free in every sense of the word.

### MOBILE

#### OS
- CalyxOS

	CalyxOS is light and whippy with private-by-default settings and optional bloatware This is how Android was meant to feel like. It reminds me of a simpler time with side loading mobile like jail breaking iPhones with sn0w. It
    
	The Aurora store is… interesting. I don’t know if I buy its claims of anonymous browsing and while downloading my giving-IP-logs-to-governments-of-teenagers-who-peacefully-protest Protonmail. I might have more of a personal inclination of using something like GraphineOS, despite its lack of normie day to day support.

- GraphineOS

	Initial thoughts, wow this is a mobile operating system with a phone at the most bare minimum. Is there an app store or do I need to compile the APKS myself? Either way, I’m sold since it is the prettiest user interface I have ever seen. Its minimalist bones with a dark silk over top. Is it a honeytrap? Do I have 100 hours to read every nook and cranny of the source code? [[should I actually read it?]]

- iOS

	Feels sleek, with a heavy dose of false sense of security. 


#### MOBILE APPS

- Wikipedia – iOS

	Upon opening the app, possibly from the webbrowser since you wasted time and resources by utilizing a search engine and having your bytes hit half a dozen servers unrelated to Wikipedia in anyway, it feels sturdy. Information is easily laid out once on the article page, with a nice relaxing [TYPE_OF_FONT]. The information is extremely vast and lacking depth, but if I had an interest on depth of a very specific subject I’d have searched elsewhere. What I expect out of Wikipedia is a 15 minute summary of a complex subject in a concise and respectful manner to the non-fringe opinion on a subject. It typically does it well, unless there’s some collusion between [[whatever the editors are called ]] to alter, twist or suppress “facts”. Luckily, this time I’m technically an expert in this article’s field and believe that I vaguely remember that MongoDB is written in C++ and has JS built in as its scripting and aggregation language or something like that, so the rest of the article is probably right. The left blade, containing the outline of the information, has a concise and pleasant font and the sizing allows for quick data transfer into one’s mind. I’ll give it $20 once a year, if I remember to grab a credit card. 


- CashApp

	Wow, tying a user to a computer and phone in relation to money and taxes, that is a feat. I thought tying the IMEI to the software implemented HOTP [[get actual acronym]] was intense, but having the user scan a QR Code from their phone to even login to the website is a whole new approach. It’s interesting technology, a technical feat when looking at it from a “computers have been around for less than 100 years, and society has been around 10,000 and this is what we have to show for it” kinda way

### Typescript
This has been the saving grace to JavaScript, second only to Mozilla Developer Network for their wonderfully written documentation for JavaScript. The nice things about JavaScript, in the browser or in a JS runtime (e.g. Deno, Node), is how fast it is. Not in computation, but in writing it. In that slop of swiftness and flexibility it facilitates a great speed of knowledge acquisition in many different computer science disciplines. JavaScript, like Python, touches front and back end web development, entire databases’ aggregation APIs, machine learning pipelines and even data science [INSERT LINKS TO THESE PROJECTS]. This is a language that has huge players using it and contributing to its expansion. There’s a problem though, it’s pretty trash. There are memes on memes about the poor implementation of certain primitives and how frustrating it is to use. Despite the validity of the meme’s claims, it is too flexible. It feels at times that it is a surprise that runs at all. It runs like honey through the hands leaving only the broken pieces of comb and remnants of honey. Typescript is the jar that holds the gelatenous mess together allowing our brains to rest easy. It combines flexibility with the pit of success [[cite]]. It feels like I’ve been given a semblance of stability, even though everything is actually an object and, in Node front-end fashion, compile down to ES3 [[CITE]], which means you can track people who have such outdated browsers to be running ES3 instead of building an option for people who don’t want to run unknown and un-auditable computer code on their local machines that have their personal data, and not the exact primitive that TS alludes to, giving the programmer a false sense of security. TS is more like sturdy gloves for a long day of union work. It definitely makes it easier for looking up which method or function is used elsewhere or a semi-useful list of every method or attribute on an object. I give it five out of ten, a traditional “I’m greatful to the establishment for allowing me to house my family this month” out of “Being given cans of beans while homeless off I-40”. If the underlining language and [[WHAT TS IS CLASSIFIED AS]] had a culture of transparency and 

## PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE FRAMEWORKS

### Web
- React.js

	When a framework - no I’m sorry, a “library”, no wait, no no it's a "framework" now - is this big then does it become it’s own paradigm as large as a ‘programming language’? What’s the point of using this again? It’s essentially a way to interact with HTML and CSS in a logical format and trick “front end developers” into not realizing they are doing a bit more than just plugging in data to the HTML template to pay them less. It also allows for the death and fetishization of true front end developers who focus entirely on the raw code which makes up the CSS, HTML, and SVG. Yes, the virtual DOM is quite the amazing feat in computer science logic. Instead of showing you what we actually write, we are going to show the user what they think we’re writing. We ?? should I align with these developers like a comrade ?? do this for two reasons: to now allow for the ease of novice developers to see the code structure and logic and to not show the user what our code is actually doing.
